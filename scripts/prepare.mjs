/**
 * `prepare` hook — builds `dist/` when the package is installed from git.
 *
 * The package publishes `dist/` only (`files`), and every entry in the
 * `exports` map points there. A registry tarball therefore arrives already
 * built, via `prepack`. A git install does not: it gets the repository, so
 * something has to build on the way in, and `prepare` is the one lifecycle
 * hook package managers run at that moment. Without it every
 * `@corbits/react-ui/...` import in the consumer resolves to a file that was
 * never generated, and the failure lands in the consumer's tree, where they
 * cannot fix it.
 *
 * Three things make this more than a one-line script:
 *
 * 1. `prepare` also runs for the *root* project on a plain `bun install` here
 *    in the repository. Building then would be wasted work at best, and
 *    recursive at worst (see 2). Being installed as a dependency is what
 *    distinguishes the two cases, and the honest signal for it is that the
 *    package directory sits inside a `node_modules` tree.
 * 2. bun does not install a git dependency's devDependencies, and the whole
 *    toolchain (swc, tsc, tailwind) is a devDependency — as it should be, a
 *    consumer must not inherit them as runtime deps. So the git-install path
 *    installs them itself, immediately before the build that needs them.
 * 3. That build cannot run inside the consumer's `node_modules`. Declaration
 *    emit has to name React's types, and installing the toolchain in place
 *    puts them under a path like
 *    `<consumer>/node_modules/.bun/@corbits+react-ui@.../node_modules/@types/react`.
 *    TypeScript refuses to write that into a `.d.ts` (TS2742, "cannot be named
 *    without a reference to ... This is likely not portable"), so `build:types`
 *    fails and every later step is skipped — including `build:css`, which is
 *    why a consumer would otherwise be left with JavaScript but no
 *    stylesheets. Building in a scratch directory outside any `node_modules`
 *    tree keeps those paths nameable; it is the same layout the build already
 *    runs in during development and on CI.
 *
 * Deliberately a no-op when `dist/` is already present: repeat installs of the
 * same commit should not pay for a rebuild.
